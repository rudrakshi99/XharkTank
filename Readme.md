# XharkTank

SharkTank is a panel of potential investors, termed as "Sharks", who listen to entrepreneurs pitch ideas for a business or product they wish to develop. These self-made multi-millionaires judge the business concepts and products pitched and then decide whether to invest their own money to help market and mentor each contestant.

## Product Flows

These are the mandatory product flows that are expected while building the backend for the XharkTank application

1. Entrepreneurs will post Pitch by providing these inputs

- Name of the entrepreneur posting the pitch
- Title of the pitch
- Business Idea for the Product they wish to develop
- Ask Expected Amount for investment
- Percentage of Equity to be diluted

2. Investors will view all the latest pitches posted to date

- If the entrepreneurs post a new pitch, that would also get listed. 

3. Investors will make a counteroffer to the pitch by providing these inputs

- Unique Id of the Pitch made by the entrepreneur
- Name of the investor making a counteroffer
- Amount ready to invest in the idea
- Ask Percentage of Equity for a company
